==============

These are my solutions to SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) problems.

The file name equals problem name on SPOJ. For example: ABCDEF.cpp is my solution for http://www.spoj.com/problems/ABCDEF/ problem written in C++ programming language.

NOTE:

It is in your own benifit that I suggest you not to directly use these solutions in spoj.

I just use it as a backup for my own codes for SPOJ problems.

WARNING!!!!

A few of the solutions might not be correct or complete.

If you want to use these codes, use at your own risk. I cannot be held guilty for any damage done to your property.
